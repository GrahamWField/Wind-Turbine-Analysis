# Wind-Turbine-Analysis
Student Project

In this project i used Python to wrangle, analyze and generate visualisations from several datasets from the German Data Registry.
The datasets are on wind turbines in Germany.


## Objective and Key Questions
The purpose of this project was to analyze data surrounding wind turbines and their growth.


•	We want to look at where the growth of gross production has taken place in Germany.

•	We want to look at how production capacity has grown over time.

•	We want to see who is responsible for the growth of this capacity both by manufacturer and state.

• We want to look at whether the growth is sustainable or not.

•	We want to conduct some time series analysis to identify trends and patterns, ultimately establishing the feasibility of the future of new turbine construction.
```
# Key Questions
i)	What relationships can we find between technical, geographic, and, summary data?
ii)	Using regression can we identify any patterns or relationships?
iii) Using Clustering can we  identify any patterns or relationships?
iv)	Does time series analysis offer any further insights?
v)	How Are thos relation ships relative to each other?
```
## Tools

For this task i used anconda, more specifically Jupyter and Tableua.
below are a list of tools i used to help mme with the analysis
```
•	Pandas: for data analysis
•	Numpy: for mathematical equations
•	Seaborn: for data visualizations
•	Matplotlib: for data visualizations
•	SciPy: for mathematical equations
•	Quandl for time series analysis
•	Sklearn for machine learning
•	Folium for geographic visualisations
```
